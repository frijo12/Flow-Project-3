# NFT Project with Enhanced borrowAuthNFT Feature

This project enhances an existing NFT contract by introducing the `borrowAuthNFT` feature, which is now publicly available. This feature allows users to access and retrieve metadata from our NFTs easily.

## Prerequisites

- Flow Playground
- Knowledge of Cadence language

## Usage Instructions

To interact with this NFT project using the Flow Playground, please follow these instructions:

1. **Develop Contract and Scripts**: Start by developing your contracts, transactions, and script files within the Flow Playground.

2. **Create an NFT Collection**: Execute the `CreateCollection` transaction to set up your NFT collection within the platform.

3. **Mint NFT**: Use the `MintNFT` transaction to mint a new NFT to your collection.

4. **Obtain NFT ID**: Run the `GetID` script to fetch the ID of your newly minted NFT. This ID will be needed for subsequent steps.

5. **Extract Metadata**: Finally, execute the `MetaData` script to retrieve metadata from the NFT using its ID.

By following these steps, users can easily leverage the new `borrowAuthNFT` feature to access public metadata associated with our NFTs.
